# WEATHER APP

This project was made using REACT and react testing library. The app was designed to forecast the weather with temperature, weather description and icon for the next 5 days. 

concepts covered:
-React
-JSX
-Props
-State
-Stateful components
-Stateless (presentational) components
-React Hooks
-React Testing Library
-Request/Response
-Error Handling

TO DO:
-currently the app uses existing data in a .json format, however I would like to connect it with a real API so that the app will continuously be updated with real-time data.
- the styling needs to be completed to ensure the icons display correctly and the text in the correct format
